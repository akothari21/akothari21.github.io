Shishir is the founder and CEO of a company called [Coda](https://coda.io/). Before that, he worked at Google on YouTube as VP of Product, Engineering, and UX for six years since 2008 (right after the YT acquisition).

Here is the terminology required to understand the article better.

## Different types of fans



 1. Superfans

* They would pay the retail price for the product

* They have the required activation energy to go find it out on their own.

* Superfan businesses focus on providing value to the customer and monetize directly. Example uber — You pay after the ride.

2. Casual fans

* Casual fans lack one of the above two criteria. 

* Casual fan businesses include media and cable where you pay for a variety of services but are a super fan of only a few.

3. Non-fans

* They have 0 of the above two categories.

* In Non-fan businesses, the product is delivered in the same way but the monetization is not direct. Example: Add supported businesses/social networks.
>  If you sell a product a-la-carte, you only get the superfans and miss out on casual ones.

Spotify converted music from a superfan business to a casual fan business. Previously people used to buy records from stores or pay $ 0.99 on iTunes for a song that they wanted to listen to. Now they have the entire bundle of things they are casual fans of. Spotify also sells cross bundles with Hulu.

## **The 4 Myths of Bundling**



**Myth #1: Bundling is bad for consumers as well as providers**

**Truth**: By bundling you create value in two ways: the providers get access to and revenue from casual fans and consumers get access to products they might become superfans of.

Example: Spotify vs iTunes. Earlier on iTunes, you’d buy only songs or categories of songs you were super interested in. Now due to having everything in a Spotify bundle, you also start listening to other types of music: English songs, instrumental, lo-fi beats for studying, etc.

**Myth #2: Revenue from bundles should be allocated based on usage**

**Truth**: The fairest way to distribute revenue to providers in a bundle is by Marginal churn contribution.

Example: In a cable bundle, ESPN and History Channel were getting almost the same amount of usage. Yet, the bundler paid both of them differently. History Channel can get from $0.20-$0.40 per month per subscriber, while ESPN collects $4–6 per month per subscriber(~20x more).
>  The best way to distribute money to provider X within a bundle is to ask “if I were to remove X from the bundle, how many people would churn?”.

If you believe this framework, then the reason ESPN would receive ~20x the amount of the History Channel is that **removing ESPN from the bundle would theoretically cause roughly 20x the number of subscribers to churn** as would removing History Channel from the bundle.

**Myth #3: Bundles will always feel like a rip-off to consumers since they represent a lack of choice**

**Truth**: For a Consumer to properly value a bundle, there must be a transparent (and reasonable) a-la-carte price for each of the products in the bundle.

McDonald’s example:

Person A: I want the big mac and I want the fries, If I buy the 2, the drink is free. 
Person B: I want the fries and I want the drink and if I buy both, the big mac is free
Person C: Kid is crying, oh there’s this happy meal with a toy, If I buy the toy, the entire meal is free.
>  In this case, everyone’s looking at the same board and the same package differently. And to everyone, it seems like a good deal.

There’s one fundamental reason why people think bundles are ripoffs when they’re not, and that reason is: **for a consumer to properly value a bundle there must be a transparent and reasonable a-la-carte price for every product in the bundle**. This is the reason why cable industries bundling is not working: people don’t know how much they’d have to pay to watch ESPN alone.
>  People’s ability to understand a bundle starts from their ability to understand its components.

**Myth #4: The best bundles are narrow and have very similar products so they make sense to consumers.**

**Truth**: The best bundle is one that minimizes the SuperFan overlap and maximizes CasualFan overlap.

It shows from the bundler's perspective that Product C is likely adding new customers to BundleY. From a consumer’s perspective, if you are a SuperFan of A or B or C, the bundle is likely a good deal — e.g. if you’re a SuperFan of A, then you “pay for A and get B and C for free”.

## **Thoughts on Netflix as a bundle and subscription**



Netflix kept its price constant for a very long time. By holding price constant, they forced themselves to think about their only plan to growth: subscriber growth and that was by making the bundle much more valuable and maximizing the casual fan overlap. Netflix did that by adding original shows.
>  Subscription has economies of scale built-in. You can create something once and sell it to the next customer for close to nothing

## Thoughts on the future of bundling



The bundle of the future will be larger and more diverse than we have today. They’ll cover products we’d have never imagined put together — like healthcare and dry cleaning maybe.

A third business model will emerge for the casual fans — a subscription bundle business model.
