## Kieth Rabois on How to Operate

Your goal, in the end, is to make a high-performance machine that runs on its own or as Warren Buffet says: Build a company that idiots can run because eventually, they will.

What is your role as a leader? Below is a quote from “High Output Management”

## Triaging — deciding the order of treatment

* As an operator, you should think like a doctor.

* In a startup where things are moving very fast and you face new problems every day, some problems may look very serious but actually they’re like cold and don’t need attention.

* Whereas some problems may present themselves as cold but if not treated immediately, it can turn out to be a fatal disease

## Editing

* Operators should be like editors. Whenever they received the first draft of anything, they take out their red pens and start striking things off.

* Here, editing is used as a metaphor for removing complexity. It’s your job to clarify and simplify things for everybody on the team. The more you simplify, the better people on the team will perform.

* People cannot understand and keep track of a complicated set of initiatives. So you have to simplify and bring it down to 2–3 words that they can easily repeat to themselves or their friends.

## Clarifying

* Ask a lot of questions. Ask yourself what are the top 3 things that matter for this company and only focus on this.

* According to Andy Grove, every step you eliminate, you can improve performance by 30–50%.

## Ensuring a consistent voice

* Your company website, your PR release, your recruiting pages should feel like it was written by one person.

* You should start with the objective that everything should feel exactly the same and then train people to identify the difference in voices and fix it.

## Delegating

* You shouldn’t be doing most of the work. In journalism, writers do most of the work, and editors just edit. The problem here is, as a founder you are responsible for everything. So how do you delegate but at the same time not abdicate. “Task-Relevant Maturity” concept from High Output Management helps.

* How mature is this person in doing something, and the more they’ve done the exact same task before, the more sort of rope you’re going to give them. And the more they’re trying something new, the more you’re going to actually instruct them and regularly monitor.

* Another concept which he’s borrowed from Peter Thiel is the 2x2 matrix for delegation.

* If the consequence of the decision if low, and your level of conviction is also low, delegate if fully. Let people learn and make mistakes.

* If the consequences of the decision are high and your level of conviction is also high then take the decision yourself.

## Barrels and ammunitions

* Barrels are great employees. The ones who can take an idea you have to your mind all the way to launching it and rally the team behind them.

* Barrels are very rare to find. The ideal way for a company to succeed is to hire 4–5 barrels, give them significant equity, great compensation, and then arm them with lots of ammunition(normal employees).

* How to spot a barrel? Look at the office and see who people are walking up to(except who they report to) when they’re facing a problem. If you see more and more people going to this single person’s desk, they’re the barrel.

## Do exactly one thing

* Peter Thiel at PayPal insisted that everyone should focus and work on exactly one thing

* If they have multiple things to focus on they will solve the B+ problem(easy problems) and never solve the A+ problem(difficult problems). So in the end you get a company where everyone is solving the B+ problems.

## Be transparent

* Everyone should have access to metrics and dashboards. At square, for every meeting which had greater than 2 people, someone would take meeting notes and send it to the entire company.

* Have glass walls for conference rooms. People tend to start wondering what's going behind the close doors.

## Always use pairing metrics and KPIs

* In insurance, if you give the risk analytics team the KPI to reduce frauds, they may start treating each and every customer like a fraud which ends up creating a bad customer experience. So pair this with CSAT and look at both together so that you don’t tend to over-optimize on something wrong.

## Always look at anomalous data

* At LinkedIn, 30% of all the clicks users did were on their own profile.

* On digging deep they found out that it was vanity clicks. People were looking at their own profile just like they would look at themselves in a mirror.

* Anomalous data will help you uncover key insights about your customer.

## Obsess over details

* If you get all the details right, you don’t have to worry about building a billion-dollar business, things will take care of themselves.

* When Bill Walsh took over the 49ers they were the worst team in football and in the next 10 years he made them NFL superstars and they won 3 super bowls. What was the first thing he did after he joined? He wrote a three-page memo teaching the receptionist how to answer the phone.

* Serve good food. This is very trivial but it matters. If people don’t like the food you’re serving, they’d go and talk shit about the food instead of solving a hard problem. Small details like this matter.

* Your job is to take things off their plate that is a distraction and provide them with tools so that they can be high-performance machines.

## Create a cult

* All good startups are like cults. That is why you should never have a shared office because it's hard to form cults in shared offices.
