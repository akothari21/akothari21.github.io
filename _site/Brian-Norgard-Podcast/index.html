                <h2 id="tinder-and-no-mind-theory"><strong>Tinder and No Mind Theory</strong></h2>

<p>Dating was a paywalled industry before tinder. You create an account, as soon as you get a message from someone, you need to pay.</p>

<p>Tinder took a very different approach, thinking about dating as content, entertainment, experience, and when you think of something like that — why would you put a paywall in front of it.</p>

<p>Instead of paying $19 a month, tinder wanted to introduce you to super like and it would give you one for free so that you can get the taste and you get the emotional energy of sending/getting a super like and then you start to make that association that these little subtle superpowers will help me have a better experience.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>People want cheat codes in life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tinder is a variable reward game and it took this idea of variable rewards and packed them inside of their core experience along with giving people these pseudo cheat codes.</p>

<p>Tinder Gold: Allows you to see who right-swiped you. If you’re serious about dating and about meeting people, you want that edge.</p>

<p>Tinder took a lot of inspiration from the gaming industry and a lot of behaviors that already existed in the app. They knew people wanted to stand out, they wanted to have a better experience. So they just gave it to them in a very subtle way in a way where a lot of people saw these paywalls. Conversion is a function of the number of times people saw these paywalls. They were not too aggressive about it. People saw this as an opportunity on the platform rather than a tax.</p>

<p>Ridiculous simplicity in monetization: Another product that was super-successful was Boost. Not a lot of mental energy required and it was one tap. When you take Boost, you get a lot of right swipes, a lot of matches, you have a delightful experience, and you look back and say: “This was because I bought boost”.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If you can tie cause and effect in a consumer tool, big things happen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simple products and even simpler branding. Tinder super like — you really like them. Tinder boost — Be exposed to more people.</p>

<p>**No Mind product theory: **You don’t educate the customer, they have to come to the conclusion about what you’re selling them on their own. Give them something very simple, digestible, and achievable.</p>

<p>We live busy lives — schedules, routines, etc. No one wants your product, no one is looking for your product, it needs to find them.</p>

<p>How you find people: Ultrasimplicity. People are not going to give you attention unless it is very digestible or very simple.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>People do not want to use your service and think, they want the service to come to them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Example Auto streaming, Autoplay. It’s passive consumption and you are able to go into a specific psychological state where you don’t have to process anything, you just let it come.</p>

<p>**Cohorts of attention **</p>

<p>TV: 2.5 hours, 1 session</p>

<p>Desktop computer: 45 mins to 1 hour, 2 sessions</p>

<p>Laptop — 30 mins, 5–6 sessions</p>

<p>Mobile — 15–20 mins, multiple sessions</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Figure out what it is that people want and give it to them in their environment. Long form content doesn’t work on mobile because everything is instagram stories, tiktok: short and ephemeral.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="podcasts-and-audio">Podcasts and audio</h2>

<p>Podcasting and AirPods phenomenon happened so fast. In the next 2 years, we don’t know where we will end up.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Voice is not a platform its an interface.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There has to be much more connectivity on the developer side to make it an interface. There have to be ways in which specific API’s exists for people to hook in to.</p>

<p><strong>Why audio is so great?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Ridiculous amounts of information density, ridiculous amounts of human touch - intonation, pitch, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Text is transactional. Emojis are needed because we needed to add. emotions to text. But audio is full of emotions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Multimodal consumption: Listening to audio is possible in a no-mind state in a multi-modal environment: driving, walking, working out. It’s very flexible compared to video which requires all of your attention.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Around 200,000 years ago humans started with sitting in groups and sharing stories around the fire. Audio is codified into our DNA.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Airpods are the second-best product Apple has ever launched right after the iPhone.</p>

<p>Glasses, helmets are a form of computing on your face. Not a lot of people like that.</p>

<p>Airpods is computing inside of you — you don’t even realize the difference.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The trajectory of technology has always been: big, medium, small, invisible. If it’s not invisible in the end, it’s not a great piece of technology. We don’t want a bunch of technology in our stuff, we want to feel free.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People who love Alexa are very young or very old. These are people who are less concerned about computing, they are just doing something functionally. 9-year-old daughter and 75-year-old parents.</p>

<p>Hard to imagine where we will be in 5 years when it understands any dialect or works when there is background noise.</p>

<p>On peloton bikes: The mirror looks like a real mirror, not some crappy hardware, video fidelity is unbelievable — it looks like it was shot on warner brothers, speaker quality is amazing. So it’s the cumulative effect of all these technologies underneath it that create an effect that never existed.</p>

<h2 id="product-design"><strong>Product design</strong></h2>

<p>Good design is always going to be scarce. It’s a function of aesthetic discipline, weight, size, materials, graphics, etc.</p>

<p>Data-driven vs design-driven: depends on the culture and the DNA of your company. Snap, Pinterest, Apple companies which value design a lot. Founders vouch for design.</p>

<p>Tinder got better at testing later in the history of the startup. Most of the things they did at the start were based on intuition. The founder had an innate feel for what made sense. The cards and swipes were all design thinking through first principles.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Good design allows you to go into no-mind and when you go into it, you give your time and attention. If you can do that over a long period of time and keep people happy, weeks months or years you develop a franchisee that lasts for decades</p>
</blockquote>
