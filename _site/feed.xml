        <title>Shishir Mehrotra - The Art and Science of Bundling</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Shishir is the founder and CEO of a company called &lt;a href=&quot;https://coda.io/&quot;&gt;Coda&lt;/a&gt;. Before that, he worked at Google on YouTube as VP of Product, Engineering, and UX for six years since 2008 (right after the YT acquisition).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the terminology required to understand the article better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5372/1*ROppwhj258MG4IZ_-ckFFA.png&quot; alt=&quot;Source: [https://coda.io/@shishir/four-myths-of-bundling](https://coda.io/@shishir/four-myths-of-bundling)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;different-types-of-fans&quot;&gt;Different types of fans&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.Superfans&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They would pay the retail price for the product&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They have the required activation energy to go find it out on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Superfan businesses focus on providing value to the customer and monetize directly. Example uber ‚Äî You pay after the ride.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.Casual fans&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Casual fans lack one of the above two criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Casual fan businesses include media and cable where you pay for a variety of services but are a super fan of only a few.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.Non-fans&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They have 0 of the above two categories.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Non-fan businesses, the product is delivered in the same way but the monetization is not direct. Example: Add supported businesses/social networks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If you sell a product a-la-carte, you only get the superfans and miss out on casual ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spotify converted music from a superfan business to a casual fan business. Previously people used to buy records from stores or pay $ 0.99 on iTunes for a song that they wanted to listen to. Now they have the entire bundle of things they are casual fans of. Spotify also sells cross bundles with Hulu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-4-myths-of-bundling&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 4 Myths of Bundling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth #1: Bundling is bad for consumers as well as providers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Truth&lt;/strong&gt;: By bundling you create value in two ways: the providers get access to and revenue from casual fans and consumers get access to products they might become superfans of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example: Spotify vs iTunes. Earlier on iTunes, you‚Äôd buy only songs or categories of songs you were super interested in. Now due to having everything in a Spotify bundle, you also start listening to other types of music: English songs, instrumental, lo-fi beats for studying, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth #2: Revenue from bundles should be allocated based on usage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Truth&lt;/strong&gt;: The fairest way to distribute revenue to providers in a bundle is by Marginal churn contribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example: In a cable bundle, ESPN and History Channel were getting almost the same amount of usage. Yet, the bundler paid both of them differently. History Channel can get from $0.20-$0.40 per month per subscriber, while ESPN collects $4‚Äì6 per month per subscriber(~20x more).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The best way to distribute money to provider X within a bundle is to ask ‚Äúif I were to remove X from the bundle, how many people would churn?‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you believe this framework, then the reason ESPN would receive ~20x the amount of the History Channel is that &lt;strong&gt;removing ESPN from the bundle would theoretically cause roughly 20x the number of subscribers to churn&lt;/strong&gt; as would removing History Channel from the bundle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth #3: Bundles will always feel like a rip-off to consumers since they represent a lack of choice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Truth&lt;/strong&gt;: For a Consumer to properly value a bundle, there must be a transparent (and reasonable) a-la-carte price for each of the products in the bundle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McDonald‚Äôs example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Person A: I want the big mac and I want the fries, If I buy the 2, the drink is free. 
Person B: I want the fries and I want the drink and if I buy both, the big mac is free
Person C: Kid is crying, oh there‚Äôs this happy meal with a toy, If I buy the toy, the entire meal is free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In this case, everyone‚Äôs looking at the same board and the same package differently. And to everyone, it seems like a good deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs one fundamental reason why people think bundles are ripoffs when they‚Äôre not, and that reason is: &lt;strong&gt;for a consumer to properly value a bundle there must be a transparent and reasonable a-la-carte price for every product in the bundle&lt;/strong&gt;. This is the reason why cable industries bundling is not working: people don‚Äôt know how much they‚Äôd have to pay to watch ESPN alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;People‚Äôs ability to understand a bundle starts from their ability to understand its components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth #4: The best bundles are narrow and have very similar products so they make sense to consumers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Truth&lt;/strong&gt;: The best bundle is one that minimizes the SuperFan overlap and maximizes CasualFan overlap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*-2GvB6LYbV7THlkanz8J4A.png&quot; alt=&quot;credits: [https://coda.io/@shishir/four-myths-of-bundling/myth-4-6](https://coda.io/@shishir/four-myths-of-bundling/myth-4-6)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It shows from the bundler‚Äôs perspective that Product C is likely adding new customers to BundleY. From a consumer‚Äôs perspective, if you are a SuperFan of A or B or C, the bundle is likely a good deal ‚Äî e.g. if you‚Äôre a SuperFan of A, then you ‚Äúpay for A and get B and C for free‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thoughts-on-netflix-as-a-bundle-and-subscription&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thoughts on Netflix as a bundle and subscription&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netflix kept its price constant for a very long time. By holding price constant, they forced themselves to think about their only plan to growth: subscriber growth and that was by making the bundle much more valuable and maximizing the casual fan overlap. Netflix did that by adding original shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Subscription has economies of scale built-in. You can create something once and sell it to the next customer for close to nothing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thoughts-on-the-future-of-bundling&quot;&gt;Thoughts on the future of bundling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bundle of the future will be larger and more diverse than we have today. They‚Äôll cover products we‚Äôd have never imagined put together ‚Äî like healthcare and dry cleaning maybe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third business model will emerge for the casual fans ‚Äî a subscription bundle business model.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Brian Norgard(Tinder) on products, design, and future of audio.</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;tinder-and-no-mind-theory&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tinder and No Mind Theory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dating was a paywalled industry before tinder. You create an account, as soon as you get a message from someone, you need to pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tinder took a very different approach, thinking about dating as content, entertainment, experience, and when you think of something like that ‚Äî why would you put a paywall in front of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of paying $19 a month, tinder wanted to introduce you to super like and it would give you one for free so that you can get the taste and you get the emotional energy of sending/getting a super like and then you start to make that association that these little subtle superpowers will help me have a better experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;People want cheat codes in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tinder is a variable reward game and it took this idea of variable rewards and packed them inside of their core experience along with giving people these pseudo cheat codes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tinder Gold: Allows you to see who right-swiped you. If you‚Äôre serious about dating and about meeting people, you want that edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tinder took a lot of inspiration from the gaming industry and a lot of behaviors that already existed in the app. They knew people wanted to stand out, they wanted to have a better experience. So they just gave it to them in a very subtle way in a way where a lot of people saw these paywalls. Conversion is a function of the number of times people saw these paywalls. They were not too aggressive about it. People saw this as an opportunity on the platform rather than a tax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ridiculous simplicity in monetization: Another product that was super-successful was Boost. Not a lot of mental energy required and it was one tap. When you take Boost, you get a lot of right swipes, a lot of matches, you have a delightful experience, and you look back and say: ‚ÄúThis was because I bought boost‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you can tie cause and effect in a consumer tool, big things happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple products and even simpler branding. Tinder super like ‚Äî you really like them. Tinder boost ‚Äî Be exposed to more people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Mind product theory:&lt;/strong&gt;You don‚Äôt educate the customer, they have to come to the conclusion about what you‚Äôre selling them on their own. Give them something very simple, digestible, and achievable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We live busy lives ‚Äî schedules, routines, etc. No one wants your product, no one is looking for your product, it needs to find them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How you find people: Ultrasimplicity. People are not going to give you attention unless it is very digestible or very simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;People do not want to use your service and think, they want the service to come to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example Auto streaming, Autoplay. It‚Äôs passive consumption and you are able to go into a specific psychological state where you don‚Äôt have to process anything, you just let it come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cohorts of attention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TV: 2.5 hours, 1 session&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desktop computer: 45 mins to 1 hour, 2 sessions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laptop ‚Äî 30 mins, 5‚Äì6 sessions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mobile ‚Äî 15‚Äì20 mins, multiple sessions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Figure out what it is that people want and give it to them in their environment. Long form content doesn‚Äôt work on mobile because everything is instagram stories, tiktok: short and ephemeral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;podcasts-and-audio&quot;&gt;Podcasts and audio&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Podcasting and AirPods phenomenon happened so fast. In the next 2 years, we don‚Äôt know where we will end up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Voice is not a platform its an interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has to be much more connectivity on the developer side to make it an interface. There have to be ways in which specific API‚Äôs exists for people to hook in to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why audio is so great?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ridiculous amounts of information density, ridiculous amounts of human touch - intonation, pitch, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Text is transactional. Emojis are needed because we needed to add. emotions to text. But audio is full of emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multimodal consumption: Listening to audio is possible in a no-mind state in a multi-modal environment: driving, walking, working out. It‚Äôs very flexible compared to video which requires all of your attention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Around 200,000 years ago humans started with sitting in groups and sharing stories around the fire. Audio is codified into our DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airpods are the second-best product Apple has ever launched right after the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glasses, helmets are a form of computing on your face. Not a lot of people like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airpods is computing inside of you ‚Äî you don‚Äôt even realize the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The trajectory of technology has always been: big, medium, small, invisible. If it‚Äôs not invisible in the end, it‚Äôs not a great piece of technology. We don‚Äôt want a bunch of technology in our stuff, we want to feel free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who love Alexa are very young or very old. These are people who are less concerned about computing, they are just doing something functionally. 9-year-old daughter and 75-year-old parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hard to imagine where we will be in 5 years when it understands any dialect or works when there is background noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On peloton bikes: The mirror looks like a real mirror, not some crappy hardware, video fidelity is unbelievable ‚Äî it looks like it was shot on warner brothers, speaker quality is amazing. So it‚Äôs the cumulative effect of all these technologies underneath it that create an effect that never existed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;product-design&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good design is always going to be scarce. It‚Äôs a function of aesthetic discipline, weight, size, materials, graphics, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data-driven vs design-driven: depends on the culture and the DNA of your company. Snap, Pinterest, Apple companies which value design a lot. Founders vouch for design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tinder got better at testing later in the history of the startup. Most of the things they did at the start were based on intuition. The founder had an innate feel for what made sense. The cards and swipes were all design thinking through first principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Good design allows you to go into no-mind and when you go into it, you give your time and attention. If you can do that over a long period of time and keep people happy, weeks months or years you develop a franchisee that lasts for decades&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Learnings from one year into Product Management</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-first-30-days&quot;&gt;The First 30 Days&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You realize this is nothing like what is written in most of the product management books&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first few days as a product manager can be really hard because you don‚Äôt know what exactly are you supposed to do, and the only reference you have is other PMs in your team. Likely, you won‚Äôt get to work on a product in the first 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*c1BLu1tFkS5IC5gKnol2-Q.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what should you do in these 30 days?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Understand the product. Here, horizontal knowledge is more helpful than vertical.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spend time with fellow PMs, understand what they do; soon you may be collaborating!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Understand how the product team operates and what are the processes followed- E.g. How are sprints planned? What prioritization method is followed? How does the product life cycle look like?.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you know what area you would be working on, start spending time with all the stakeholders and try to understand how they feel about the existing product.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-next-30-days&quot;&gt;The Next 30 Days&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Working on your first product as a PM can be overwhelming&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may slip up initially but eventually, you can lessen that by asking the right questions, being more observant, getting well versed with the processes, and structuring your thought process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to make sure to do a good job while working on your first product?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don‚Äôt judge too early- You might have immediate suggestions. Thoughts like why wasn‚Äôt this feature built earlier might come across your mind. Interrupt yourself there and try to understand the history of the product and why it has progressed in a certain way.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Revisit your thoughts every day- Initially, it may be hard to ask the right questions (Honestly, it will always be hard). However, you can get better at it. Run through your thoughts and try to understand the whys, whats, hows, and that‚Äôs when questions will start flooding into your mind. Eventually, you‚Äôll be able to do this in realtime&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Understand what can be measured- Data shouldn‚Äôt be used to back your product. That would imply confirmation bias towards the product. Data should be used as an illuminator to understand what should we build or what went wrong in what we built. *‚ÄúWhich is that one data point that will shoot your own idea?‚Äù *This is a critical thing that I learned from my Manager at Bounce. You can read an article on a talk he gave on &lt;a href=&quot;https://yourstory.com/2020/03/future-of-work-bounce-aditya-jalan-data&quot;&gt;How to build a culture of data-led decisions&lt;/a&gt;. Trust me, this will change your way of thinking about data!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don‚Äôt be afraid to make mistakes or to accept them. You can‚Äôt escape from either! You have to acknowledge your mistakes to get better and honor the person who pointed it out. The benefit of receiving critical feedback in the early days of career is very huge&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take help from other PMs- They already know the dynamics within the team and across teams. Little guidance and some perspective does no harm.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-did-the-next-10-months-teach-me&quot;&gt;What did the next 10 months teach me?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-there-is-nothing-called-over-communication&quot;&gt;1. There is nothing called over-communication&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs okay to repeat the same thing you‚Äôve told earlier instead of assuming that your stakeholders would know. What we often feel is over-communication is the optimum amount. The chances of retaining the information also increase when you‚Äôve repeated it multiple times&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consistency is very important while communicating. Try to develop a pattern that others can acknowledge well. Here, communicating cyclically and in a particular format helps. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Documenting everything on the go and keeping it handy is an efficient approach to share information whenever required.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach helped when we had made a complex logic change which would decide how often and when we ask users to fill the NPS survey. I had multiple people across the company enquiring about it since NPS data is consumed by various teams. Having the logic well documented helped as I could share the same document every time someone wanted to understand how we collected NPS scores&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communicating necessarily doesn‚Äôt have to be a formal, concise email but casually catching up with your stakeholders, say over lunch, and making sure that they are aligned with you is important. Often PMs don‚Äôt succeed in communicating well when they are not comfortable with their responsibility. If you have clarity in your mind you should be able to propagate it to every stakeholder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relevance of communication increases with an increase in team sizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about chances of miscommunication or ‚ÄòThere is a communication gap‚Äô?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2216/1*dGKP-cApceMY753WvVp8mQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;The famous handshake problem; and that would be 435 calls&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You‚Äôve to do the job of making sure everyone who makes a call has the same understanding of what you have communicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*M0T5o4SCIE2ac28ZIDlDfQ.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the above points may not be prevalent if you work in a small team (&amp;lt;50) it is always good to learn this early in career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-colleagues-who-question-you-hard-can-shape-your-career&quot;&gt;2. Colleagues who question you hard can shape your career&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to build a culture where people challenge each other‚Äôs ideas vigorously. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;As PM one should set up the environment comfortable enough for the engineer or any stakeholder to freely push back and speak up about vital ideas and problems.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Engaging in open and intense debates helps one identify flaws in the approach and accommodate different point of views&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You get better at asking questions by being questioned hard. Good questions trigger critical thought processes that help you act better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*pb1_xdQDcVRGPZS7NqcgpQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-accepting-responsibility&quot;&gt;3. Accepting Responsibility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone and everyone can be a bystander but you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2024/1*NNBcq-yl2cExzTbqDpzzEA.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to be the facilitator to support everyone so that they do their best. This means you would have to take responsibility and dive into each of the domains to some extent. You can‚Äôt be a watcher or instructor from outside. While all teams like design and engineering work independently yet you have a significant share of responsibility towards each of them to make sure they can do the right things at the right time with ease. Remove dependencies and unblock them as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you accept responsibilities with comfort, you earn your team‚Äôs trust. They find you reliable. You become a PM who makes their boss‚Äôs life easier by being someone who can be given full ownership with no uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-empathy-only-for-customers-is-not-enough&quot;&gt;4. Empathy only for customers is not enough&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Empathize. Not just with customers but your engineers. Think about how you can make their lives better. What do they want? Humanize yourself. A lot of PM Engineer relation is where engineers feel PMs are someone who are ‚Äòabove‚Äô the engineers and tell them what to do. Don‚Äôt support this notion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When things go wrong you‚Äôve to be the person who says ‚ÄúWe will fix this‚Äù instead of a person who would say ‚ÄúEngineering team has to fix it‚Äù You‚Äôve to break barriers between engineering and product team and promote them to function as a one team working towards common goals of solving customer problems. Things, like including them in product decisions and acknowledging their opinion, are of much value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be grateful for all the times they worked to ship the best instead of criticizing the one time they couldn‚Äôt,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-you-dont-need-to-buy-pizza-for-your-team-to-get-work-done&quot;&gt;5. You don‚Äôt need to buy pizza for your team to get work done&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The greatest motivation to work is contributing to success. Over time, I have realized that it is a false belief that people have to incentivized to perform best. Great teams and best products are built when every single member knows where they‚Äôre heading to and why? These are the people who look forward to challenges and are excited to tackle them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3068/1*QFnnoCwlayRb6HNvqzcCGA.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a PM it is important to set the direction for everyone and make them aware of their contribution and impact which will ensure that the team is ready to do whatever it requires to reach the goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;6-take-stand-dont-be-a-pushover&quot;&gt;6. Take stand! Don‚Äôt be a pushover.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take stand as long as no one can prove you wrong. Open to be proven wrong. But don‚Äôt easily overcome your opinion because others disagree with it. Try your best to convey what led you to that thought process and convince the team. Get comfortable with disagreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One year into product management has been a period of infinite learning. Seeing customers happy and creating delightful experiences for them remain the best part of this journey and I look forward to more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
