<p>"Be who you needed when you were younger" We stand by this quote. This is our little effort to give back to the product community by helping people who aspire to become PMs. Less than a year back, we were just like you, passionately trying to pursue the career that we love. We see this as our chance to encourage and support young, aspiring PMs who absolutely love the profession and want to make a difference and create an impact through this career choice. </p>

    <h2><span>What do you get to learn?</span></h2>
</div>
<p>A course or a book cannot teach you what product management is because product management requires you to be competent in various domains like tech, strategy design, communication, stakeholder management, problem solving etc. Essentially, you have to learn a bit of each of these to learn Product Management. We will provide you with a personalised learning experience where we would be solving some of the real life case studies and help you model your approach like a PM. We would also be hosting speaker from other domains to demonstrate how PMs work with different stakeholders.</p>
<div class="section-title">
    <h2><span>Who can attend?</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Someone who has the burning desire to become a PM! Someone who is willing to take this thing as a P0 in their life for the next 2-3 months</p>

A few months of investment towards learning product management if you are really passionate about it will turn out to be way more valuable and fruitful than any of these degrees. Here, the investment has to be in the form of dedication, hard work, commitment and passion. </li></ul>
