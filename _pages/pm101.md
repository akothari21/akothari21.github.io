<p><strong>"Be who you needed when you were younger."</strong></p> 

<p>We stand by this quote. Less than a year ago, we were just like you, grasping, riling, and raging to make sense of the world of product management. It was a journey of ups and downs, falling and pushing ourselves up, but it was an adventure through which we learned a lot.  This is our guide down the exciting road of Product Management, our effort to give back to the product community.</p> 

<p>We wish to inspire, support, and educate aspiring Product Managers. If you are in love with the profession and wish to make a positive impact in this world of products, these sessions are tailored for you.  We hope you make the best of it.</p>

A few months of investment towards learning product management will turn out to be way more valuable and fruitful than any of these degrees. The only investment required here is dedication, hard work, commitment, and passion. </li></ul>
