<p>3 minute reads is our attempt to curate, simplify and summarize some timeless books, videos, blogs and podcasts about product, design, business, strategy and investing and provide it in an easy to read 3-minute article.</p>

    <h2><span>Our Vision</span></h2>
</div>
<p>In the past few years due to the ease of technology and the rise of easy to use tools, content creation has exploded. Almost everyone you know now has a blog, given a talk somewhere, or hosting a podcast. But all content is not created equal. Some of the content is written by content creators with the aim to make quick ad dollars and that's why it is mostly bluff and appears on top of google search results. 

Some pieces of content are timely - like news - it's no longer useful for you to read it once again after a year. On the other hand, some of the finest pieces of content on the internet are timeless and you won't ever find them on the first page of google search. This kind of content is solid and you learn something new out of it every single time you read it. 

We all have busy lives - working jobs, taking care of our families and household and some recreation. There's very little time to work on ourselves and become a better person. Some of the finest videos are 1 hour long and some of the finest books are around 400-500 pages. Our aim with 3 minute reads is to become that layer of curation which helps in discovering, simplifying and summarising all of the timeless content on the internet and at the same time removing that cognitive overload from you and helping you become a better person.</p>
